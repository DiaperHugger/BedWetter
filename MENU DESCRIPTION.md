Home Screen:

   1: The diaper icon will flash when the program is running.
   2: The "H" indicates that the secondary relay is active. A "h" indicates that an IdleTemp is controlling the secondary relay with optional temp sensor.
   3: Total liquid flow can be displayed with optional flow meter.
   4: RunTime counter keeps track of total program run time. 
   5: "NewRun" tag indicates new times will be generated with selected options.
   6: Temperature will display if sensor is present. Can be changed from C to F in sensor menu.

TIMES: TOTAL SLEEP/h:

   The total sleep time in hours.

TIMES: INITIAL DLY/m:

   The initial delay to start the program. This value is added to all three random types.

WETTING: WET CHANCE%:

   This is a percentage chance that any relay activation will happen. If the TOTAL SLEEP is entered the RUNTIME counter will still count.

WETTING: RANDOM: NONE

   This will divied the INTERVAL and DURATION into the TOTAL SLEEP time evenly.

WETTING: RANDOM: PURE
    
   This will create random interval and duration times using the entered values as limts. Note that the total number of intervals will not change only the interval times!
